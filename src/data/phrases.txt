Go cold turkey
Fit as a fiddle
Piece of cake
Cold feet
Go down that road
Straight from the horse's mouth
Between a rock and a hard place
Cut corners
No pain no gain
Cost an arm and a leg
Time flies when youâ€™re having fun
Elephant in the room
Steal their thunder
A stone's throw
Not my cup of tea
Couch potato
Kill two birds with one stone
Green fingers
Under the weather
Hit the sack
Lose your touch
Leave no stone unturned
Hang in there
Bust your chops
Jump ship
Heard it on the grapevine
Let them off the hook
Barking up the wrong tree
Once in a blue moon
Cold shoulder
Nip in the bud
Call a spade a spade
Take the mickey
Hit the nail on the head
Pitch in
Wouldn't be caught dead
Stab them in the back
Desperate times call for desperate measures
Go back to the drawing board
Rule of thumb
Head over heels
Through thick and thin
Miss the boat
Scratch my back
Cheap as chips
Pigs might fly
Get your act together
Pull yourself together
The best of both worlds
By the skin of your teeth
Fish out of water
Clam up
Take it with a pinch of salt
Stick to my guns
Eat a horse
Spill the beans
The grass is always greener
Raise your game
Call it a day
Get up on the wrong side of bed
Get out of hand
Bob's your uncle
So far, so good
No-brainer
Cost a bomb
It's not rocket science
Hold your horses
Don't put all your eggs in one basket
Follow in someone's footsteps
We'll cross that bridge when we come to it
Face the music
Speak of the devil
See eye to eye
A spanner in the works
Jump on the bandwagon
Wild goose chase
Keep your chin up
Waste not, want not
Better late than never
Get off my back
Ring a bell
Your guess is as good as mine
Find your feet
Cut to the chase
All ears
Wrap my head around it
You can't judge a book by its cover
Don't run before you can walk
Budge up
Ignorance is bliss
You can say that again
Get it out of my system
Couldn't care less
Up in the air
Sit on the fence
Freak out
On the straight and narrow
Smell a rat
Get over something
Twisting my arm
Blow off steam
A taste of your own medicine
On the ball
Don't give up the day job
Full of beans
The ball is in your court
Splash out
Eyes in the back of your head
A blessing in disguise
Glad to see the back of
Go the extra mile
Add insult to injury
Botch job
Chip on their shoulder
Let the cat out of the bag
Every cloud has a silver lining
Give them the benefit of the doubt
Off the top of my head
The last straw
Hit the books
Sit tight
Bog-standard
Hit the road
Let sleeping dogs lie
Builder's tea
Bite the bullet
Cut a long story short
Dig your heels in
At a crossroads
Sleep on it
On the pull
Shoot from the hip
Cut someone some slack
Bury your head in the sand
Off your trolley
Actions speak louder than words
A sandwich short of a picnic
Finger in every pie
Bite off more than you can chew
Dog eat dog
Rock the boat
Look like a million dollars
Play it by ear
Shed light on it
Curiosity killed the cat
Add fuel to the fire
Easy does it
Pulling my leg
Chinese whispers
Beat about the bush
